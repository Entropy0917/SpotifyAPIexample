# SpotifyAPIexample
## Example of me learning and using the Spotify API and Spotipy library in Python.

The example uses local host to log into your account and give you your top artist over a "short term" or around the last 4 weeks. If you would like to get started on your own Spotify API here are some links:

* [SpotifyAPI](https://developer.spotify.com/)

  Scopes used:

* [playlist-read-private](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-list-users-playlists)
* [user-top-read](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-users-top-artists-and-tracks)

  Libraries Used:
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/installation/)
* [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
* [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.25.1/)

This is a very basic example of the SpotifyAPI and only prints a simple list. Great starting point for someone looking to start building a fun website with the SpotifyAPI. ðŸ˜„
